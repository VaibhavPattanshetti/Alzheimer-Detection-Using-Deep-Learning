Alzheimer’s Disease Classification (AD vs Normal) using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a deep learning–based medical imaging system to classify MRI brain scans as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) or Normal. The objective is to support early detection by developing a reliable and high-recall classification model using transfer learning.

🧠 Problem Statement

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease is critical but challenging. Manual MRI analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. This project applies deep learning to automate MRI classification and assist clinical decision-making.
